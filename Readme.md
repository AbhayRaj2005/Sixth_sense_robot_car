# Sixth Sense Bot

An Arduino-based robot controlled over Serial commands, with real-time visual feedback on an onboard LED Matrix and an indicator LED — driven by a webcam color-tracking controller.

## Overview

The bot is controlled by a webcam-based color-tracking controller running on a PC. A colored object is tracked in real time using OpenCV; depending on which on-screen zone (Up/Down/Left/Right/Middle) the object is in, a single-character command is sent over Serial to the Arduino. The Arduino then drives the motors accordingly and shows live directional feedback on its onboard LED Matrix.

## Features

- Serial command control: `F` (forward), `B` (backward), `L` (left), `R` (right), `S` (stop)
- Live directional feedback via `Arduino_LED_Matrix` (arrow icons + stop icon)
- LED blink feedback synced to each movement command
- Simple dual-motor driver logic (2 motors, 4 direction pins)
- Webcam color-object tracking controller (Python/OpenCV) that drives the bot by moving a colored object across on-screen zones

## Hardware

| Component        | Pin |
|-------------------|-----|
| Motor A IN1        | 5   |
| Motor A IN2        | 6   |
| Motor B IN1         | 9   |
| Motor B IN2         | 10  |
| Status LED           | 13  |

Board: Arduino UNO R4 (built-in LED Matrix support required).

## How the firmware works

The board listens on Serial (9600 baud) for single-character commands. On each command it:
1. Drives the motors in the corresponding direction
2. Renders the matching arrow/stop bitmap on the LED matrix
3. Blinks the status LED a number of times unique to that command

## How the Computer Vision controller works

A Python script opens the webcam, tracks a chosen color object using HSV masking and contour detection, and sends `F`/`B`/`L`/`R`/`S` over Serial to the Arduino based on which on-screen zone the object's centroid falls into.
